.SH NAME
update-language, update-fmtutil, update-fmtlang \- update
various TeX-related configuration files

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B update-language

.B update-fmtutil
.RI [ options ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page explains briefly the usage of the three TeX configuration
update programs
.B update-language
and \fBupdate-fmtutil\fP.
.PP
The
.B update-fontlang
script should not be called directly, but only via the two described links.
For a more in-depth description, please see the document \fITeX on Debian\fP in
.I /usr/share/doc/tex-common/TeX-on-Debian.txt.gz
(also available as HTML and PDF).

The programs \fBupdate-language\fP and
\fBupdate-fmtutil\fP create or update the configuration files
\fIlanguage.dat\fP and \fIfmtutil.cnf\fP, respectively.
These files define 
the hyphenation patterns to be loaded into LaTeX-related
TeX formats (\fIlanguage.dat\fP), and the list of formats to be created
(\fIfmtutil.cnf\fP).

These programs can be used either in system-wide mode if called by root, or
in a user-specific mode if called by a user without super-user privileges.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-c\  DIR ,\ \-\-conf-dir= DIR
directory where the user-specific configuration files are looked for in
user-specific mode (default 
\fITEXMFCONFIG/language.d\fP for \fBupdate-language\fP
and \fITEXMFCONFIG/fmt.d\fP for \fBupdate-fmtutil\fP, where \fITEXMFCONFIG\fP
is usually \fI$HOME/.texmf-config\fP).
.TP
.BI \-o\  FILE ,\ \-\-output-file= FILE
file to write the output to. Per default, in system-wide mode,
\fBupdate-language\fP writes to 
\fI/var/lib/texmf/tex/generic/config/language.dat\fP
and
\fBupdate-fmtutil\fP writes to
\fI/var/lib/texmf/web2c/fmtutil.cnf\fP.
.TP
.B \-\-checks
perform sanity checks on the generated config file. Don't use this
in maintainer scripts.
.TP
.B \-\-quiet
don't write anything to the standard output during normal operation
.TP
.B \-\-help
print a summary of the command-line usage and exit
.TP
.B \-\-version
output version information and exit

.SH USAGE

In system-wide mode, both programs merge those files
("configuration snippets") with a specific extension in the respective
configuration directories to produce the final file. These
configuration directories and extensions are \fIlanguage.d\fP and
\fB.cnf\fP for \fBupdate-language\fP, 
and \fIfmt.d\fP and \fB.cnf\fP for \fBupdate-fmtutil\fP.
In system-wide mode, these directories are those under \fI/etc/texmf/\fP. Both
TeX add-on packages and local administrators can add files to these
directories.

If a package that provides such snippets is removed but not purged,
including the snippet will likely break the system.  To prevent the
inclusion in these cases, snippets installed by \fIpackages\fP have to
contain a magic header:

# -_- DebPkgProvidedMaps -_-

which local administrators should \fInot\fP remove.  From the files
with a magic header, only those files which are also listed in one of
the files in
.I /var/lib/tex-common/language-cnf/
for \fBupdate-language\fP, and
.I /var/lib/tex-common/fmtutil-cnf/
for \fBupdate-fmtutil\fP, are actually included into the final output
file. This way, local changes to the configuration can be preserved
while the package is in state 'rc' (that is, the package is removed, but its
configuration files are still present).  For details about this mechanism,
package maintainers should consult the Debian TeX Policy.  As a
special case, the files for JadeTeX and xmlTeX are only included if
there is already a file for the LaTeX format (see \fITeX on Debian\fP
for details).

The user-specific mode provides a way for a non-admin user to override
system-wide settings.  In this mode,
\fBupdate-language\fP writes to 
\fITEXMFVAR/tex/generic/config/language.dat\fP, and
\fBupdate-fmtutil\fP writes to
\fITEXMFVAR/web2c/fmtutil.cnf\fP, where \fITEXMFVAR\fP is usually
\fI$HOME/.texmf-var\fP. 
Furthermore, files present within the user-specific configuration
directories are included \fIin addition\fP to the files present in the
system-wide configuration directories.  In case the same filename
exists in the system-wide configuration directory and the
user-specific configuration directory, the user-specific file is used
instead of the system-wide one. The user-specific configuration directories
are
\fITEXMFCONFIG/language.d\fP for \fBupdate-language\fP and
\fITEXMFCONFIG/fmt.d\fP
for \fBupdate-fmtutil\fP, where \fITEXMFCONFIG\fP is usually
\fI$HOME/.texmf-config\fP. The system-wide configuration directories have the
same names, but are located in \fI/etc/texmf/\fP instead of \fITEXMFCONFIG\fP.

Note that changes introduced by updates of packages are \fInot\fP
propagated to the user's configuration files. This has to be done by hand.
