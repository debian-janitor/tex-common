.Sh DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents
.Nm ,
a program that was written for the Debian distribution.
.Ss Overview
.Nm
is used to generate
.Xr updmap 1 Ns 's
and 
.Xr updmap-sys 8 Ns 's
site-wide configuration file,
.Pa /var/lib/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg ,
or the per-user configuration file,
.Pa TEXMFCONFIG/web2c/updmap.cfg ,
from the files with names ending in
.Ql .cfg
located in
.Pa /etc/texmf/updmap.d/ .
.Pp
The base TeX packages (texlive-) provide files in
.Pa /etc/texmf/updmap.d/ ,
which define the base contents of the to\-be\-generated
.Pa /var/lib/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
(general settings and base fonts), or the per-user file 
.Pa TEXMFCONFIG/web2c/updmap.cfg .
With the underlying mechanism, system
administrators can disable the map files they want by commenting their
entries in the appropriate files under
.Pa /etc/texmf/updmap.d/ .
Such changes will be preserved if the package in question is removed
(not purged) and then reinstalled.
.Pp
Users without local administration rights can use 
.Nm
to merge their local configuration and an updated site-wide
configuration (see 
.Sx User-specific configuration 
below).  The local configuration files, unless specified otherwise, are
expected in 
.Pa $TEXMFCONFIG/updmap.d ,
(that is
.Pa ~/.texmf-config/updmap.d ),
and the default output file is
.Pa $TEXMFVAR/web2c/updmap.cfg
(in other words,
.Pa ~/.texmf-var/web2c/updmap.cfg ).
.Pp
Thanks to
.Nm ,
TeX-related font packages can have their own font map files referenced in
.Pa /var/lib/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
without having to edit that file.  The packages simply have to ship their map files (e.g.,
.Pa foo.map )
in
.Pa /etc/texmf/map/dvips/
and one or more
.Ql .cfg
file(s) under
.Pa /etc/texmf/updmap.d/
(e.g.,
.Pa  10foo.cfg )
referencing the map files.
.Ss "Mode of operation"
.Nm
concatenates all the
.Ql .cfg
files under
.Pa /etc/texmf/updmap.d/
provided that:
.Bl -dash -offset indent -compact
.It
they do not contain the following pseudo-comment:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# -_- DebPkgProvidedMaps -_-
.Ed
.Pp
or;
.It
they have this pseudo-comment, are up-to-date (i.e., the same file
with suffix
.Ql .dpkg-new
doesn't exist) and are listed in a
.Ql .list
file under
.Pa /var/lib/tex-common/fontmap-cfg/ ,
meaning that the package shipping the
.Ql .cfg
file is installed. The name of the
.Ql .list
file is ignored (but should be the name of the package that installed
it). The file should contain the names of the 
.Ql .cfg
files in 
.Pa /etc/texmf/updmap.d/
that should be enabled, without the
.Ql .cfg
suffix, e.g. 
.Bd -literal -offset indent
10foo
12bar
.Ed
.El
.Pp
The first case is for configuration files added by the local system
administrator. Files that contain the magic pseudo-comment should be
used by Debian packages. In this case, only the base name should appear
in the
.Ql .list
file: for instance,
.Ql 10foo
for
.Pa /etc/texmf/updmap.d/10foo.cfg ;
please refer to the Debian TeX Policy for details.
.Ss "Names for configuration files"
Filenames should begin with two digits and must have the extension 
.Ql .cfg .
The order used to process the
files is obtained by running
.Xr sort 1
with the
.Sq C
locale (for ordinary alphanumeric characters, it corresponds to the
.Tn ASCII
order).  The result obtained by concatenating them is stored as the new
.Pa updmap.cfg .
Note that 
.Xr updmap 1 Ns 
and
.Xr updmap-sys 8 Ns
don't care about the order of entries, the sorting is just for the
user's convenience.
.Pp
If you want to be able to use
.Xr updmap 1 Ns 's
or
.Xr updmap-sys 8 Ns 's
option
.Fl -enable
and 
.Fl -setoption ,
some further 
.Sy Restrictions
apply to the filenames used and the way
entries are distributed among these files.  For
.Fl -setoption
to work, the options (like 
.Ev dvipsPreferOutline )
must be kept in a file named 
.Pa 00updmap.cfg ,
either
in 
.Pa /etc/texmf/updmap.d/
as installed by the 
.Nm tex-common
package, or in the 
.Va conf-dir
you specified.  If you use 
.Fl -enable
.Ar Map some.map
and there is no mention of 
.Ar some.map
in any file in 
.Pa /etc/texmf/updmap.d/
(and in 
.Va conf-dir ,
if specified), then the Map line will be introduced in a file whose name matches 
.Pa *local*.cfg
if it exists, or
.Pa 99local.cfg
will be created (in 
.Va conf-dir
if specified).  For this to work, you cannot have more than one file
that matches that name, except that you can use
.Pa conf-dir/*local.cfg
to supersede the site-wide file in 
.Pa /etc/texmf/updmap.d/ .
.Pp
In order to enable a Map file that already is listed in your
configuration files, it must be commented with the string '#! '.  This
is the sort of lines that
.Dl updmap --disable some.map
will produce - see also
.Xr updmap.cfg 5 Ns .
If such a line occurs in more than one file,
.Xr updmap 1 Ns 
 will fail.  Again the exception is a file in
.Pa conf-dir
that shadows entries in a site-wide file.
.Pp
Although not strictly mandatory, it is wise to keep corresponding Map
entries in files with the same name in 
.Pa conf-dir
and the site-wide dir.  Otherwise, the results may seem unpredictable.
.Ss "User-specific configuration"
If you want a different configuration for
.Xr updmap 1 Ns
 than the setup at your site provides, you can place changed copies of
the configuration files from
.Pa /etc/texmf/updmap.d/
in a directory below 
.Va $TEXMFCONFIG ,
or create additional files there.  Per default, files are looked for in
.Pa $TEXMFCONFIG/updmap.d ,
where
.Ev $TEXMFCONFIG
is
.Pa ~/.texmf-config
unless the configuration has been changed.  When you call
.Nm
as a user,  it will produce a user-specific 
.Pa updmap.cfg
file as follows: if files with the same name exist in both directories,
the version in
.Pa ~/.texmf-config/updmap.d/
will be used; files with unique names will be used from either
directory. 
.Pp
If you want to keep your files elsewhere, specify their location with
options (see 
.Sx OPTIONS
below).
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl -version"
.It Fl c, -conf-dir Ev conf-dir
in user-specific mode, use configuration files from 
.Ev conf-dir
instead of 
.Pa $TEXMFCONFIG/updmap.d/
.It Fl  o, -output-file Ev outputfile
in user-specific mode, generate 
.Ev outputfile
instead of
.Pa $TEXMFVAR/web2c/updmap.cfg
.It Fl -check
Executes additional checks that all necessary files are present in the
kpathsea database. Don't use this in maintainer scripts.
.It Fl -quiet
don't write anything to the standard output during normal operation
.It Fl -help
print a summary of the command-line usage of
.Nm
and exit
.It Fl -version
output version information and exit
.El
.Pp
Note that the
.Fl v
option, which turns on verbose mode, is deprecated.  We are currently in a
transition phase where quiet mode is still the default (therefore,
.Fl -quiet
has no effect), but
.Nm
will be verbose by default as soon as enough packages use
.Fl -quiet
in their maintainer scripts.
.Sh "SYNTAX FOR THE .CFG FILES"
The
.Ql .cfg
files under
.Pa /etc/texmf/updmap.d/
should contain valid configuration lines for
.Xr updmap 1 .
Usually, they will consist of lines of following one of these forms:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Map <foo.map>
MixedMap <bar.map>
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Li MixedMap
form should only be used if the font is available in both bitmap and scalable
formats (this way, it won't be declared in the default map file for Dvips that
is used
when
.Li dvipsPreferOutline
is set to
.Ql false
in
.Pa updmap.cfg ) .
.Pp
The following comment (from
.Xr updmap 1 Ns 's
point of view):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# -_- DebPkgProvidedMaps -_-
.Ed
.Pp
is treated in a particular way by
.Nm
(see section
.Sx "Mode of operation"
above) and should be used in every
.Ql .cfg
file provided by a Debian package.  This ensures that the corresponding
map files are disabled when the package is removed and reenabled when
the package is reinstalled.
