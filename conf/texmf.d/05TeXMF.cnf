% original texmf.cnf -- runtime path configuration file for kpathsea.
% (If you change or delete `original' on the previous line, the
% distribution won't install its version over yours.)
% Public domain.
% 
% What follows is a super-summary of what this .cnf file can
% contain. Please read the Kpathsea manual for more information.
% 
% texmf.cnf is generated from texmf.in, by replacing @var@ with the
% value of the Make variable `var', via a sed file texmf.sed, generated
% (once) by kpathsea/Makefile (itself generated from kpathsea/Makefile.in
% by configure).
% 
% Any identifier (sticking to A-Za-z_ for names is safest) can be assigned.
% The `=' (and surrounding spaces) is optional.
% No % or @ in texmf.in, for the sake of autogeneration.
% (However, %'s and @'s can be edited into texmf.cnf or put in envvar values.)
% $foo (or ${foo}) in a value expands to the envvar or cnf value of foo.
% 
% Earlier entries (in the same or another file) override later ones, and
% an environment variable foo overrides any texmf.cnf definition of foo.
% 
% All definitions are read before anything is expanded, so you can use
% variables before they are defined. 
% 
% If a variable assignment is qualified with `.PROGRAM', it is ignored
% unless the current executable (last filename component of argv[0]) is
% named PROGRAM.  This foo.PROGRAM construct is not recognized on the
% right-hand side. For environment variables, use FOO_PROGRAM.
% 
% Which file formats use which paths for searches is described in the
% various programs' and the kpathsea documentation.
% 
% // means to search subdirectories (recursively).
% A leading !! means to look only in the ls-R db, never on the disk.
% A leading/trailing/doubled ; in the paths will be expanded into the
%   compile-time default. Probably not what you want.
% 
% You can use brace notation, for example: /usr/local/{mytex:othertex}
% expands to /usr/local/mytex:/usr/local/othertex.  Instead of the path
% separator you can use a comma: /usr/local/{mytex,othertex} also expands
% to /usr/local/mytex:/usr/local/othertex.  However, the use of the comma
% instead of the path separator is deprecated.
%
% The text above assumes thet path separator is a colon (:).  Non-UNIX
% systems use different path separators, like the semicolon (;).

%  Part 1: Search paths and directories.

% You can set an environment variable to override TEXMF if you're testing
% a new TeX tree, without changing anything else.
% 
% You may wish to use one of the $SELFAUTO... variables here so TeX will
% find where to look dynamically.  See the manual and the definition
% below of TEXMFCNF.

% The tree containing the runtime files closely related to the specific
% program version used:
TEXMFMAIN = /usr/share/texmf

% The main distribution tree:
% TEXMFDIST = /usr/share/texmf-dist
% TEXMFDIST is not used in Debian, everything is in $TEXMFMAIN
TEXMFDIST = $TEXMFMAIN


% A place for local additions to a "standard" texmf tree.
% This tree is not used for local configuration maintained by
% texconfig, it uses TEXMFCONFIG below.
TEXMFLOCAL = /usr/local/share/texmf

% TEXMFSYSVAR, where texconfig-sys stores variable runtime data.
% With teTeX-3.0 or later, this must be set.
% For sharing this tree with $TEXMFMAIN:
%   TEXMFSYSVAR = $TEXMFMAIN
% For using a separate tree:
%   TEXMFSYSVAR = /usr/share/texmf-var
% Debian uses this separate TEXMFSYSVAR tree:
TEXMFSYSVAR = /var/lib/texmf

% TEXMFSYSCONFIG, where texconfig-sys stores configuration data.
% With teTeX-3.0 or later, this must be set.
% For sharing this tree with $TEXMFMAIN:
%   TEXMFSYSCONFIG = $TEXMFMAIN
% For using a separate tree:
%   TEXMFSYSCONFIG = /usr/share/texmf-config
% In Debian, this should be the same as TEXMFMAIN
TEXMFSYSCONFIG = $TEXMFMAIN

% User texmf trees can be catered for like this...
% This used to be HOMETEXMF.
TEXMFHOME = $HOME/texmf

% TEXMFVAR, where texconfig stores variable runtime data.
% With teTeX-3.0 or later, this must be set.
% For sharing this tree with $TEXMFMAIN:
%   TEXMFVAR = $TEXMFMAIN
% For using a separate tree:
%   TEXMFVAR = $HOME/.texmf-var
TEXMFVAR = $HOME/.texmf-var

% TEXMFCONFIG, where texconfig stores configuration data.
% With teTeX-3.0 or later, this must be set.
% For sharing this tree with $TEXMFMAIN:
%   TEXMFCONFIG = $TEXMFMAIN
% For using a separate tree:
%   TEXMFCONFIG = $HOME/.texmf-config
% For using a separate tree:
%   TEXMFCONFIG = /usr/share/texmf-config
TEXMFCONFIG = $HOME/.texmf-config

% Now, list all the texmf trees. If you have multiple trees you can
% use shell brace notation, like this:
%   TEXMF = {$TEXMFHOME,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFMAIN}
% The braces are necessary.
%
% For texconfig to work properly, TEXMFCONGIG and TEXMFVAR should be named
% explicitly and before all other trees.
TEXMF = {!!$TEXMFCONFIG,!!$TEXMFVAR,$TEXMFHOME,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFMAIN}

% The system trees.  These are the trees that are shared by all the users.
SYSTEXMF = $TEXMFLOCAL;$TEXMFMAIN;$TEXMFDIST

% Where generated fonts may be written.  This tree is used when the sources
% were found in a system tree and either that tree wasn't writable, or the
% varfonts feature was enabled in MT_FEATURES in mktex.cnf.
VARTEXFONTS = /var/cache/fonts

% Where to look for ls-R files.  There need not be an ls-R in the
% directories in this path, but if there is one, Kpathsea will use it.
%
% Remove $VARTEXFONTS from TEXMFDBS if the VARTEXFONTS directory is below
% one of the TEXMF directories (avoids overlapping ls-R files).
TEXMFDBS = $TEXMF;$VARTEXFONTS

% It may be convenient to define TEXMF like this:
%   TEXMF = {$TEXMFHOME,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFMAIN,$HOME}
% which allows users to set up entire texmf trees, and tells TeX to
% look in places like ~/tex and ~/bibtex.  If you do this, define TEXMFDBS
% like this:
%   TEXMFDBS = $TEXMFHOME;$TEXMFLOCAL;$TEXMFMAIN;$VARTEXFONTS
% or mktexlsr will generate an ls-R file for $HOME when called, which is
% rarely desirable.  If you do this you'll want to define SYSTEXMF like
% this:
%   SYSTEXMF = $TEXMFLOCAL;$TEXMFMAIN;$TEXMFDIST
% so that fonts from a user's tree won't escape into the global trees.
%
% On some systems, there will be a system tree which contains all the font
% files that may be created as well as the formats.  For example
%   TEXMFVAR = /var/lib/texmf
% is used on many Linux systems.  In this case, set VARTEXFONTS like this
%   VARTEXFONTS = $TEXMFVAR/fonts
% and do not mention it in TEXMFDBS (but _do_ mention TEXMFVAR).
