* switch to full trigger
* use file triggers instead of name triggers
* remove all post install code for TeX packages
* move hyphen to /var/lib/tex-common, allow only for *one* additional
  file /etc/texmf/web2c/hyphen-changes, ignore all other files in
  /etc/texmf/hyphen.d
* Generate the files with a perl script that loads all default,
  and then replaces/adds those in /etc/texmf/web2c/hyphen-changes
  (this is newer than TL, we should incorporate this approach in TL, too)





* remove all the luajittex bla bla from tex-common
* disable luajittex format in texlive-base


* move all the trigger code into update-texmf-conf
* make distinction between trigger call and normal clal


* rewrite policy and user documentation!!!
  - updmap.d handling has disappeared
  - texmf.d handling has changed, changes to /etc/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
    are NOT USER EDITABLE ANYMORE
    exclusive use of /etc/texmf/texmf.d
