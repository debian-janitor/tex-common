* long term aim: fully trigger supported
  - fmtutil must go multi
  - move fmtutil.cnf snippets to /var/lib/tex-common
  - is this good? if we do this we always have to call fmtutil-sys --all
    ... which might be a pain ...
* rewrite policy and user documentation!!!
  - updmap.d handling has disappeared
  - texmf.d handling has changed, changes to /etc/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
    are NOT USER EDITABLE ANYMORE
    exclusive use of /etc/texmf/texmf.d
