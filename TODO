* remove all post install code for TeX packages

	not all
  add again: that in the postinst run 
  	dpkg-trigger /some/things
  especially for formats and mktexlsr is necessary

  otherwise if there is a problem with that, then a later call
  to dpkg --configure -a does not rerun the trigger actions!


* remove all the luajittex bla bla from tex-common
* disable luajittex format in texlive-base

* move all the trigger code into update-texmf-conf
	why? how should this work?
* make distinction between trigger call and normal clal


* rewrite policy and user documentation!!!
  - updmap.d handling has disappeared
  - texmf.d handling has changed, changes to /etc/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
    are NOT USER EDITABLE ANYMORE
    exclusive use of /etc/texmf/texmf.d
    removed hyphen.d
    etc etc etc
