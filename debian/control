Description: Common infrastructure for using and building TeX in Debian
 This package contains a number of scripts and common configuration
 files that are needed to install a TeX System, either teTeX or
 TeX-Live.
 .
 It also contains some files used when creating tetex packages from
 the Debian source packages, and which allow a synchronisation between
 the two source packages of teTeX (tetex-base and tetex-bin) and
 tex-live.
