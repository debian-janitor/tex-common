	* ltxmisc.tpm is added, but the individual files have not been checked

	* Wrote an e-mail to Axel Kielhorn (the address he uses in usenet,
  	Axel.NoSpam@gmx.de, since the one in adrconv's files bounces

	* Fixed the tetex-src part of the script

	* Wrote an other mail to Lars Engebretsen, regarding ae fonts

	* tpm2licenses can now be installed and called with perl
	/usr/share/tex-common/tpm2licenses (or simply use
	dpkg-statoverride to make it executable...)

	* This file is actually a Change Log only for my copyright/license
	verification work
