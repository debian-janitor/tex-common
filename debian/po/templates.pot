"A TeX system may have to generate new font data (pixel data, metric, "

"If you accept, you can specify a group name and *all* directories under /var/"

"The default is not to manage permissions with debconf, but this is just "

#. In this paragraph, the wording is ambiguous (it could be read as,
#. but does *not* mean: 'the account "nobody" is member of
#. "users"').  This should be changed the next time that we have to
#. change the english templates, anyway. Meanwhile, translators
#. should take care to take the correct meaning.
