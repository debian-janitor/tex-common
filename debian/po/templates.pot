"A TeX system needs  to generate new font data (pixel data, metric, sources) "
"on the fly. These files can be saved into the TeX font cache in /var/cache/"

"If you do not accept, the font cache directory will be world-writeable, "

"If you accept, you can specify a group name and all directories under /var/"
"cache/fonts will get ownership root:<groupname> and permission bits 3775 (i."
"e. writable for the group <groupname>, sticky and setgid bit set). "
"Accordingly, the ls-R index file will be owned and writable by that group."

"If you accept, font generation on multi-user machines will only work for "

"The default is not to manage permissions with debconf, but this is just "
"because this is required for automatic installs on Debian package building "

"multi-user servers, accepting this is strongly recommended!"

"The default is \"users\",  Note that on a Debian system, no local user is "
