#
#    Translators, if you are not familiar with the PO format, gettext
#    documentation is worth reading, especially sections dedicated to
#    this format, e.g. by running:
#         info -n '(gettext)PO Files'
#         info -n '(gettext)Header Entry'
#
#    Some information specific to po-debconf are available at
#            /usr/share/doc/po-debconf/README-trans
#         or http://www.debian.org/intl/l10n/po-debconf/README-trans
#
#    Developers do not need to manually edit POT or PO files.

"There are many files installed in a typical TeX system. To speed up the "

" - main: usually /usr/share/texmf, contains only files installed\n"

" - local: usually /usr/local/share/texmf, contains local additions\n"
" - var: usually /var/lib/texmf, contains generated files from the\n"
