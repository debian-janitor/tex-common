tex-common (1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Manually reinstalling removed conffiles
  
    Due to a bug in the postrm script of tetex-base in etch, purging this
    package removes essential configuration files of texlive
    packages. tex-common is also affected, because tetex-base removed
    /etc/texmf/web2c/mktex.cnf.  This file isn't strictly needed, but it
    is very much recommended that you reinstall it.  You can find a copy
    in /usr/share/tex-common/.

tex-common (1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Filename database in $TEXMFHOME is no longer created and updated
  
    The ls-R filename database in $TEXMFHOME, $HOME/texmf, is no longer
    created in new installs, and also not updated by default.  This makes
    sense unless you have a very large number of files installed in that
    tree. 
  
    However, you MUST remove the old file $HOME/texmf/ls-R in order to
    allow TeX to find new files in that hierarchy!
   
  * Backwards compatibility hacks dropped
  
    In etch, some tools and search paths still supported obsolete paths
    and invocations.  These backwards compatibility hacks, most notably to
    the *-sys tools and font search paths, have now been dropped.

  * The parse-first-line feature is now enabled by default, in order to
    allow MetaPost to call TeX with different formats.  Only when invoked
    as "teX" it is disabled to remain Knuth-compatible.

  * New font cache handling
  
    The font cache handling has been reworked completely.  By default, a
    separate font cache is kept for each user.  If you want to re-enable
    site-wide caching, see the instructions in README.Debian.  On systems
    where $HOME is not writable, fonts will be temporarily cached in
    /tmp/texfonts. 
  
  * Breakage with TeXLive
  
    The texlive packages as of version 2005-2 do not automatically create
    a user's TEXMFVAR directory for font caching. This might break
    document processing in some configurations. Simply create the
    directory $HOME/.texmf-var manually to fix this.
