  * New font cache handling
  
    The font cache handling has been reworked completely.  By default, a
    separate font cache is kept for each user.  If you want to re-enable
    site-wide caching, see the instructions in README.Debian.  On systems
    where $HOME is not writable, fonts will be temporarily cached in
    /tmp/texfonts. 
  
  * Breakage with TeXLive
  
    The texlive packages as of version 2005-2 do not automatically create
    a user's TEXMFVAR directory for font caching. This might break
    document processing in some configurations. Simply create the
    directory $HOME/.texmf-var manually to fix this.
