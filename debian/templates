Template: tex-common/managecache
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Manage the permissions of the TeX font cache with debconf?
 A TeX system needs  to generate new font data (pixel data, metric,
 sources) on the fly. These files can be saved into the TeX font cache
 in /var/cache/fonts and later reused.
 .
 If you do not accept, the font cache directory will be world-writable
 which is a security risk.  If you accept, you can specify a group
 name and all directories under /var/cache/fonts will get ownership
 root:<groupname> and permission bits 3775.
 .
 If you accept, font generation on multi-user machines will only work
 for users that have been added to the group you chose - this has to
 be done manually by you!  On machines used only by a single user, the
 setup will try to automatically detect a suitable group.
 .
 The default is not to manage permissions with debconf, but this is just
 because this is required for automatic installs on Debian package
 building machines (buildds).  In almost every other setup, like
 desktop machines or multi-user servers, accepting this is strongly
 recommended!

Template: tex-common/singleuser
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: internal item, question mark for lintian?
 Internal item which tells postinst whether config thinks only one
 user works on this system

Type: string
Default: users

# Don't translate "users" in quotation marks, it is the name of the
# default group as found in /etc/groups.
_Description: Group that should own the TeX font cache:
 You can choose a specific group which will own all directories under and
 including the TeX font cache /var/cache/fonts. These directories will 
 get permission 3775.
 .
 The default is "users",  Note that on a Debian system, no local user is
 member of the "users" group by default, so you have to add them manually!

_Description: Group that should own the TeX font cache:
 You can choose a specific group which will own all directories under and
 including the TeX font cache /var/cache/fonts. These directories will 
 get permission 3775.
 .
 The setup detected only a single user who works on this system.  If
 this is correct, the best choice is to choose this user's private group 
 with the same name as the user name.
 .
 If it is incorrect and more users are supposed to work on this
 machine, or if daemons running as system users will use TeX, it is
 suggested to choose an existing group, like "users", and add the
 required users manually.

Template: tex-common/invalid_groupname
Type: note
Description: The group name you entered, ${badgroup}, does not exist
 The setup has tried to change ownership of a test file to the group
 you entered in the previous dialog box, 
 .
 ${badgroup}
 .
 but this failed.  You will be asked again; please enter the name (not
 the numeric ID) of a group that exists on your system. 

Template: tex-common/cnf_name
Type: note
_Description: Change of name of files in /etc/texmf/texmf.d/
 texmf.cnf has previously been generated by update-texmf from all files in
 /etc/texmf/texmf.d/. Now update-texmf is changed and only reads files with
 extension '.cnf'.
 .
 So if you had any private file in /etc/texmf/texmf.d/, then you should add
 '.cnf' to its name; for example, 22mymacro => 22mymacro.cnf.

Template: tex-common/check_texmf_missing

_Description: Essential entry missing in ${filename}
 An essential entry is missing in ${filename}:
 .
 No setting of ${variable}.

 TeX will not work without it, you need to fix your configuration
 files.  The version of ${filename} that is provided by the package
 should be available as ${filename}.dpkg-dist.

 Exiting.
