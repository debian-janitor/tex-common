Template: tex-common/managedlsr
Type: multiselect
Choices: main, cache, var
Default: cache
_Description: Select the ls-R file which should be writable by their respective group.
 There are many files installed in a typical TeX system. To speed up the
 search of these files a list of available files is stored in a file called
 ls-R. There are three different locations for TeX files on a Debian system:
  - main: usually /usr/share/texmf, contains only files installed
    by debian packages.
  - var: usually /var/lib/texmf, contains generated files from the
    TeX system like format files.
  - cache: usually /var/cache/fonts, contains generated fonts.
 .
 You can select from these three locations those whose ls-R files should
 be group writable. Group write permissions for deselected ls-R will
 be removed.
 .
 We suggest selecting cache (this is the defaults) and allowing
 a selected user group to modify these ls-R files, because of the following
 reasons:
 .
 A lot of font files have to be generated before they can be used by xdvi,
 dvips etc. These files are stored in /var/cache/fonts, so that they do not
 need to be regenerated every time.  Usually, these files are created on-the-fly 
 when needed.  Since the directory is group-writable, the ls-R file should
 be the same

Template: tex-common/groupname
Type: string
Default: users
_Description: Which group should own the ls-R files?
 You can choose a specific group which the previously selected ls-R files
 should belong to. If you do not enter a group name here, the group
 ownership of the selected files will not be touched at all. If you
 have selected 'cache' in the previous question, we would suggest to select
 the group 'users' here.

Template: tex-common/cnf_name
Type: note
_Description: Change of name of files in /etc/texmf/texmf.d/
 texmf.cnf has previously been generated by update-texmf from all files in
 /etc/texmf/texmf.d/. Now update-texmf is changed and only reads files with
 extension '.cnf'
 .
 So if you had any private file in /etc/texmf/texmf.d/, then you should add
 '.cnf' to its name; for example, 22mymacro => 22mymacro.cnf
