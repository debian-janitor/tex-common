_Description: mktex.cnf in /etc/ shadows changed /usr/share/texmf/web2c/mktex.cnf
 The mechanism of TeX font caching has changed, requiring the
 installation of /usr/share/texmf/web2c/mktex.cnf.  On your system,
 ${sysconfig}/web2c/mktex.cnf exists with possible local changes, and
 makes the new file invisible to TeX.  Font caching might not work
 until the setting of MT_FEATURES has been transferred to your
 configuration file.

_Description: Change of name of files in /etc/texmf/texmf.d/
 texmf.cnf has previously been generated by update-texmf from all files in
 /etc/texmf/texmf.d/. Now update-texmf is changed and only reads files with
 extension '.cnf'.
 .
 So if you had any private file in /etc/texmf/texmf.d/, then you should add
 '.cnf' to its name; for example, 22mymacro => 22mymacro.cnf.
