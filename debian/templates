Default: false
_Description: Manage the permissions of the TeX font cache with debconf?
 A TeX system may have to generate new font data (pixel data, metric,
 sources) on the fly. These files can be saved into the TeX font cache
 in /var/cache/fonts and later reused.
 .
 If you accept, you can specify a group name and *all* directories under
 /var/cache/fonts will get ownership root:<groupname> and permission
 bits 3775 (i.e. writable for the group <groupname>, sticky and setgid
 bit set).  Accordingly, the ls-R index file will be owned and writable
 by that group.
 .
 If you accept, font generation will only work for users that have been 
 added to the group you chose - this has to be done manually by you!
 .
 The default is not to manage permissions with debconf, but this is just
 because this is required for building other Debian packages.  In almost
 every other setup, like desktop machines or multi-user servers, accepting 
 this (and adding users to the group) is strongly recommended!

Type: string
Default: users
_Description: Group that should own the TeX font cache
 You can choose a specific group which will own all directories under and
 including the TeX font cache /var/cache/fonts. These directories will 
 get permission 3775.
 .
 Note that on a Debian system, nobody is member of the "users" group by
 default, they have to be added manually!

Template: tex-common/cnf_name
Type: note
_Description: Change of name of files in /etc/texmf/texmf.d/
 texmf.cnf has previously been generated by update-texmf from all files in
 /etc/texmf/texmf.d/. Now update-texmf is changed and only reads files with
 extension '.cnf'.
 .
 So if you had any private file in /etc/texmf/texmf.d/, then you should add
 '.cnf' to its name; for example, 22mymacro => 22mymacro.cnf.
