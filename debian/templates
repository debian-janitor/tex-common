Template: tex-common/managedlsr
Type: multiselect
_Choices: main, cache, local, var
Default: cache, local
_Description: Select the ls-R file which should be managed by debconf
 There are many files installed in a typical TeX system. To speed up the
 search of these files a list of available files is stored in a file called
 ls-R. There are four different locations for TeX files on a Debian system:
  - main: usually /usr/share/texmf, contains only files installed
    by debian packages.
  - local: usually /usr/local/share/texmf, contains local additions
  - var: usually /var/lib/texmf, contains generated files from the
    TeX system like format files.
  - cache: usually /var/cache/fonts, contains generated fonts.
 You can select from these four locations those whose ls-R file should be
 managed by debconf.
 .
 We suggest selecting cache and local (these are the defaults) and allowing
 a selected user group to modify these ls-R files out of the following
 reasons:
 .
 A lot of font files have to be generated before they can be used by xdvi,
 dvips etc. These files are stored in /var/cache/fonts, so that they do not
 need to be regenerated every time.
 .
 Some users may have the right to add files to the local texmf tree, so
 they should also be allowed to change the ls-R file.
 .
 Accepting this option will allow you to easily manage the permissions of
 those ls-R files using debconf. Otherwise you will have to manually ensure
 that they get useful but safe permissions.

Template: tex-common/groupname
Type: string
Default: users
_Description: Which group should own the ls-R files?
 Modification of ls-R files can be restricted to the members of one group
 which owns them.  To take advantage of this, add the users to the group of
 your choice, and enter that group name here.  The default group, 'users',
 is appropriate for most systems.

Template: tex-common/groupperm
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Allow group members to modify ls-R files?
 Accepting this option will allow members of the owning group to modify the
 ls-R files.

Template: tex-common/userperm
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Allow all users to modify ls-R files?
 Accepting this option will allow all users to modify ls-R files.  This is
 generally not a good idea for security reasons; you should instead
 restrict such access to members of one group.

Template: tex-common/cnf_name
Type: note
_Description: Change of name of files in /etc/texmf/texmf.d/
 texmf.cnf has previously been generated by update-texmf from all files in
 /etc/texmf/texmf.d/. Now update-texmf is changed and only reads files with
 extension '.cnf'
 .
 So if you had any private file in /etc/texmf/texmf.d/, then you should add
 '.cnf' to its name; for example, 22mymacro => 22mymacro.cnf
