tex-common (0.27) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Policy Change:  Treat configuration files properly as Debian Policy
    mandates.  The only TeX-specific addition is that we remind
    maintainers to only treat files for site-wide changes as configuration
    files, not files intended to change the typeset output on a
    per-document or per-project basis.  Consequently, mktex.cnf is now
    installed as /etc/texmf/web2c/mktex.cnf.  Thanks to Manoj Srivastava!
    This closes: #379089, a RC bug, hence the medium urgency [frank]
  * Really install NEWS.Debian about the font cache changes in the last
    upload [frank]
  * Update changelog for 0.16. We forgot to close two bugs. [hilmar-guest]

  * Font data are now cached separately for each user, or in /tmp/texfonts
    when there is no writable home directory.  Thus we could get rid of
    the complicated debconf questions related to that issue (there's still
    one note left) (closes: #376050, #366805, #368411).  Many thanks to
    Ralf Stubner for his "braindump".
  
    This change requires installation of a file in a TEXMF tree; we
    therefore run mktexlsr if it is available. [frank]

  * common.functions.in: [florent]
      + change create_tetex_formats() so that fmtutil-sys is run in a
        temporary directory; otherwise, it may use files lying in the
        current directory, which can cause bad surprises. This will close
        #377581 when propagated to the various packages using this function
        in their maintainer scripts.
      + replace `command args ...` with $(command args ...) everywhere in
        the file.

    group name typed by the user, test whether it really exists.
    Furthermore, if there is only one user in the "normal user" range in

    add --quiet to the call of update-updmap in the debhelper scripts

  * In fact install the pdf version of the Policy draft, but include it in
    the tar.gz file.  Thus we can drop the Build-dependency on
    tetex-extra.  A working TeX system is only needed on the developer's
    system if the policy source has been changed.
