tex-common (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Check for correct setting of TEXFONTMAPS after possible user
    interaction in postinst, and fail with a clear error message, instead
    waiting for teTeX's or TeXLive's updmap calls to fail (closes maybe:
    #338585) [frank]
  * Add a function clean_texenvironment to common.functions, to be used
    from TeX package's postinst scripts, and document that in the Policy
    document. [frank]
  * Add the md5sum of the postinst-edited 00updmap.cfg to ucf's database.
    Also fix the logic for taking over changed settings from tetex-base,
    and create 00updmap.cfg with proper permissions.  Special thanks to
    Junichi Uekawa <dancer@netfort.gr.jp> for insisting (closes: #335682,
    #338689) [frank]
  * The Policy draft has been extended [frank]
  * change TEXMFSYSCONFIG to /etc/texmf and remove the !! before TEXMFCONFIG
    in TEXMF [preining]
  * add TEXMFSYSCONFIG to TEXMF and and reshuffle the order [preining]
  * change TEXMFDBS [preining]
  * Translations:
    - add Swedish debconf translation, thanks to Daniel Nylander
      <yeager@lidkoping.net> (closes: #338866) [frank]
    - update Danish debconf translation, thanks to Claus Hindsgaul

tex-common (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * tex-common should only Suggest debhelper, not Depend on it. It would
    pull in too many dev packages for every normal user. [preining]
  * Fix the syntax of some eval statements in the config script (closes:
    #336951) [frank]
  * In postinst, create nonexistent ls-R files with proper magic content
    if they are not already present (closes: #337073) [frank]
  * The config script was not idempotent, and reset the debconf default
    for group writable ls-R files on a fresh install. [frank]
  * Remove the ls-R symlink in TEXMFLOCAL, thanks to Lars Wirzenius
    <liw@iki.fi> (closes: #333308). [frank] 
  * Check for leftover .svn directories during build (closes: #327785)
    [frank] 
  * Add the md5sum of a version with a newer comment to the list of known
    md5sums for 00updmap.cfg (closes: #336713) [frank]
  * fix installation of debhelper snippet postrm-texfonts. [preining]
  * actually allow multiple invocations of dh_installtexfonts and
    stop with error if a cfg file is installed several times. [preining]

 -- Frank Küster <frank@debian.org>  Wed,  9 Nov 2005 14:45:34 +0100

tex-common (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change ls-R file handling to be useful. Don't use debconf as
    registry. (Closes: #332264) [preining]
  * install debhelper dh_installtexfonts script (closes: #320147) [preining]
  * A few changes to update-fontlang, most notably that it will now check,
    when invoked as update-updmap, whether /usr/share/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
    exists and abort with an explanation in that case. [frn]
  * Translations:
    - updated Danish debconf translation, thanks to Claus Hindsgaul
      <claus_h@image.dk> (closes: #332699) [frank]
    - updated French debconf translation, thanks to Clément Stenac
      <zorglub@via.ecp.fr> (closes: #335776) [frank]
    - updated Italian debconf translation, thanks to Luca Monducci
      <luca.mo@tiscali.it> (closes: #336093) [frank]

tex-common (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change hyph_size to 8191 - according to DEK it should be a prime
    number.  [frank]
  * Add a (closes:...) to the last version's changelog entry to make
    tracking history easier, in fact the bug has been closed manually
    [frank]. 
  * fix update-texmf to not go into an endless loop when called with an
    unknown option [frank]
  * Modify postrm.in script to remove TEXMFSYSVAR and /var/cache/fonts
    (thus also removing left over files at purge time) [preining]
  * manage ls-R files using debconf [preining].  The translations have
    been copied over from tetex-bin [frank]. (Closes: #328291)
  * Let the debconf dependency be created by debhelper, thus allowing
    debconf-2.0 as an alternative [frank] (closes: #332115)
  * In fact install the pdf version of the Policy draft, but include it in
    the tar.gz file.  Thus we can drop the Build-dependency on
    tetex-extra.  A working TeX system is only needed on the developer's
    system if the policy source has been changed.

  * move old config files in /usr/share/texmf/web2c out of the way [preining]

tex-common (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Refine the updmap transition code

    tetex-bin.
  * Move LSRS variable to common.variables

    Norbert Preining and Hans Hagen (Closes: #318872).
  * language.dat is now a generated file in VARTEXMF, and the actual
    conffiles are in /etc/texmf/language.d.  This allows packages to add
    hyphenation patterns - many thanks again to Norbert.
  * Merged update-updmap and update-language into one file, and
    fixed location of memory files in update-updmap
  * Install the symlink to texmf.cnf

tex-common (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * provide an upgrade path for the configuration items taken over from
    tetex-base 
  * Add a versioned conflict on tetex-base - they would remove our
    00updmap.cfg file.

 -- Frank Küster <frank@debian.org>  Wed,  6 Jul 2005 17:36:30 +0200
