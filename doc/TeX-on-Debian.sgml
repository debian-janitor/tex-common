      <heading>Overview of the packages</heading>

      <p>
        The Debian teTeX packages are comprised of:
        <taglist>
          <tag><package>tetex-bin</package></tag>
          <item>
            provides the binary files
          </item>

          <tag><package>tetex-base</package></tag>
          <item>
            provides the most basic TeX and LaTeX input files, and will be
            sufficient for some simple documents, e.g. to build the
            documentation of other Debian packages (hopefully)
          </item>

          <tag><package>tetex-extra</package></tag
          <item>
            contains lots of fonts and add-on packages for LaTeX and TeX
            development. If you want to use LaTeX to write and format your own
            documents, you will probably need many of these.
          </item>

          <tag><package>tetex-doc</package></tag>
          <item>
            the free part (according to the Debian Free Software Guidelines)
            of the documentation for <package>tetex-bin</package>,
            <package>tetex-base</package> and <package>tetex-extra</package>.
            It is not needed to build existing documents, but as an author,
            you will for sure want to install it.
          </item>

          <tag><package>tetex-doc-nonfree</package></tag>
          <item>
            the non-free part (according to the Debian Free Software
            Guidelines) of the documentation for <package>tetex-bin</package>,
            <package>tetex-base</package> and <package>tetex-extra</package>
          </item>

          <tag><package>tetex-src</package></tag>
          <item>
            the sources (i.e., <file>.dtx</file> files) of all the TeX/LaTeX
            files in <package>tetex-base</package> and
            <package>tetex-extra</package>, and of the documentation in
            <package>tetex-doc</package>. This package will only be needed by
            (La)TeX developers, or if you want to look up licensing
            information.
          </item>
        </taglist>
      </p>

      <p>

	    group and on some other packages to create something
            similar to a full TeX Live installation
          </item>

	  <tag><package>texlive-doc-*</package></tag>
          <item>
	    packages like <package>texlive-doc-en</package> and
            <package>texlive-doc-de</package> provide documentation in
            the respective language
          </item>

	  <tag><package>texlive-lang-*</package></tag>
          <item>
	    packages like <package>texlive-lang-dutch</package> and
            <package>texlive-lang-spanish</package> provide
            language-specific support, like hyphenation patterns
          </item>
	</taglist>
        There are many more packages, providing extra functionality
        and extra fonts. Please see the respective descriptions of
        these packages.

          If you want to add files, you should usually use
          <var>TEXMFLOCAL</var> or <var>TEXMFHOME</var>, depending on whether
          you are the system administrator or a user. If needed, a system
          administrator can add additional trees to the <var>TEXMF</var>
          variable in <file>/etc/texmf/texmf.d/05TeXMF.cnf</file> (earlier
          entries take precedence). <var>TEXMFCONFIG</var> and
          <var>TEXMFVAR</var> are used by the user-specific
          <prgn>texconfig</prgn>, <prgn>updmap</prgn>, and
          <prgn>fmtutil</prgn> commands. Note
	  that <prgn>texconfig</prgn> creates a copy of configuration
	  files from <var>TEXMFMAIN</var> (or <file>/etc/texmf</file>)
	  at the time it is first invoked, and does not track later
	  system-wide changes, and it does not know
	  about <prgn>update-*</prgn> programs (see
	  below <ref id="sec-core-config-files">

          <heading>System-wide versus user-specific configuration</heading>
          <p>
            TeX Live as well as, since version 3.0, teTeX, supports a
            complete user-specific configuration setup in the user's
            home directory. System administrators must use the
            commands <prgn>texconfig-sys</prgn>,
            <prgn>fmtutil-sys</prgn> and <prgn>updmap-sys</prgn> which act on
            the system-wide configuration files. Users can invoke their user
            counterparts <prgn>texconfig</prgn>, <prgn>fmtutil</prgn> and
            <prgn>updmap</prgn>. This will put copies of the system-wide
            configuration files into the user's <var>TEXMFCONFIG</var> directory
            (by default, <file>$HOME/.texmf-config</file>), modify them and
            generate according formats, if applicable.
          </p>
	  <p>
	    There is no such mechanism for <file>texmf.cnf</file>.
	    For a way to customize <file>texmf.cnf</file> as a user,
	    see <ref id="sec-user-config-files">.
	  </p>

        <sect1>
          <heading>Configuration file placement</heading>
          <p>
            On a TeX system, in principle every TeX input file can be used to
            <em>change the behavior of the system</em> and hence could
            be treated as a configuration file. To avoid an inflation
            of configuration files, those that are used to control the
            typeset output - the appearance of documents - are not
            installed as configuration files.  It makes more sense to
            keep changed versions in the current directory for a
            certain project, or in <var>TEXMFHOME</var>
            or <var>TEXMFCONFIG</var> of a particular user.  However,
            local admins can take any file they want from
            the <var>TEXMFDIST</var>
            (<file>/usr/share/texmf-tetex</file>)
            or <var>TEXMFMAIN</var> (<file>/usr/share/texmf</file>)
            trees and put changed copies into the respective
            directories below <file>/etc/texmf</file>
            (<var>TEXMFSYSCONFIG</var> which sorts before all other
            trees).
          </p>

          <p>
            Since the package management system does not know whether a file
            is treated as a configuration file on a specific system, it is up
            to the site admin or local user to check whether one of their
            changed files has changed in <var>TEXMFMAIN</var> or
            <var>TEXMFDIST</var>.
          </p>

         <sect1>
          <heading>What is configured where?</heading>
          <p>
            The central system-wide configuration files <file>texmf.cnf</file>
            (which controls the basic operation and file search paths for the
            included programs), <file>fmtutil.cnf</file> (which specifies the
            available TeX formats), <file>updmap.cfg</file> (font
            configuration) and <file>language.dat</file> (hyphenation patterns
            for many formats) are handled through a Debian-specific mechanism
            that allows the basic TeX packages, add-on packages and local
            administrators to combine their changes
            (see <ref id="sec-core-config-files"> below).
          </p>

          <p>
            For some configuration changes, there is a program called
            <prgn>texconfig-dialog</prgn> (or simply <prgn>texconfig</prgn>
            for a commandline frontend); alternatively, you can of course make
            the necessary changes in configuration files by hand.
          </p>

      <sect>
        <heading>Hyphenation</heading>
        <p>
          Hyphenation should pretty much work out of the box. In
          teTeX, there have been some changes in the
          past&mdash;see <file>NEWS.Debian</file> and
          <file>changelog.Debian</file>&mdash;but currently (nearly) all
          available patterns are enabled. If you want to use a reduced set of
          hyphenation patterns (which might gain you a trifle more speed), you
          can exclude them from the format file by changing the file specified
          in the third column of <file>fmtutil.cnf</file>&mdash;usually
          <file>language.dat</file>&mdash;and rebuild the formats with
          <prgn>fmtutil</prgn> or <prgn>fmtutil-sys</prgn>. Please note that
          in Debian, language.dat is a generated file (see <ref
          id="sec-core-config-files">).
        </p>

        <p>
          For users of the norwegian language and teTeX, there are several
          alternatives. For norwegian, there are different sets of patterns,
          and upstream chose <file>nohyphb.tex</file>. Details can be found in
          <file>/usr/share/texmf/doc/generic/nohyph/README.nohyph</file>&mdash;you
          can choose another one by editing <file>language.dat</file> or
          rather <file>/etc/texmf/language.d/01tetex.cnf</file>.
        </p>

        <p>
          For users of the ukranian language (with teTeX and TeX
          live), the right pattern file depends on the output encoding 
          (see <file>/usr/share/texmf-{tetex,texlive}/tex/generic/ukrhyph/ukrhyph.tex</file>);
          you can also choose different rule sets in the file.
        </p>
	<p>
	  There are currently no free hyphenation patterns for british
	  english.  Before enabling british/UKenglish, you need to get the
	  non-free ukhyphen.tex - otherwise the format generation will
	  fail.  Don't forget to complain to the UK TUG  about how
	  annoying this is...
	</p>

          The files <file>texmf.cnf</file>, <file>fmtutil.cnf</file>,
          <file>updmap.cfg</file> and <file>language.dat</file>
        </heading>
	<p>
	  In the following we describe ways to configure these files
	  for the <em>system administrator</em>, i.e. one that has
	  write access to the <file>/etc/texmf</file> hierachy. In
	  <ref id="sec-user-config-files"> we describe a per-user
	  configuration.
        <p>
          The files <file>texmf.cnf</file>, <file>fmtutil.cnf</file>,
          <file>updmap.cfg</file> and <file>language.dat</file>
          contain configuration options from teTeX and/or TeX Live,
          possibly from you, and from other TeX-related packages. They
          are generated by scripts and should not&mdash;in fact,
          except <file>texmf.cnf</file> may not&mdash;be edited
          directly. Rather, you should work with the source files in the
          respective directories below <file>/etc/texmf/</file>.
        </p>

        <p>
          In order to make updates smooth, you should <em>avoid
          editing</em> system-wide files as far as possible, and
          instead <em>add new files</em> to change
          settings. For <file>texmf.cnf</file> snippets, this is
          particularly easy, since earlier entries override any later
          entries.  Only for removing settings
          from <file>fmtutil.cnf</file>,
          <file>updmap.cfg</file> or <file>language.dat</file> is it necessary
          to edit existing files.

          </heading>
          <p>
            The TeX binaries are built to look for <file>texmf.cnf</file> (the
            master config file for TeX and MetaFont) in
            <file>/usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf</file> (or
            <file>$HOME/.texmf-config/web2c/texmf.cnf</file> if it exists).
            The system-wide file is a symbolic link to
            <file>/etc/texmf/texmf.cnf</file>. The Debian packaging includes a
            mechanism for constructing texmf.cnf from a collection of files
            under <file>/etc/texmf/texmf.d/</file>. To customize
            <file>texmf.cnf</file> while retaining the Debian-supplied
            configuration, create an appropriate file (or files) in
            <file>/etc/texmf/texmf.d/</file>, or change existing
            files, and then run <prgn>update-texmf</prgn>. This will
            generate the desired <file>texmf.cnf</file> for you.
          </p>

          <p>
            You should not edit this file directly! While changes made
            by the local administrator will not be overwritten, they
            will cause you trouble once a package is updated and
            brings in a configuration change. You will be shown the
            differences between the edited and the newly generated
            file. We will try to merge our and your changes, but that
            might not always work, and you will probably have to edit
            again.
          </p>

          <p>
            Therefore, if you want a smooth upgrade, please edit the files in
            <file>/etc/texmf/texmf.d</file>, or create an additional one, and
            invoke <prgn>update-texmf</prgn>. This will write your changes
            into <file>/etc/texmf/texmf.cnf</file>.
          </p>

          <p>
            You should name your customization file something like
            <file>40macros.cnf</file>; the leading numerals will decide the
            order in which configuration fragments will be assembled by
            <prgn>update-texmf</prgn>, so it might be important to place your
            customizations in an appropriate place in the sequence &mdash;
            earlier definitions take precedence over later ones.  In
            previous versions the extension <tt>.cnf</tt> was not
            necessary, and all files in the directory were used.  If you
            had <package>teTeX</package> installed in woody, you might
            still have private files which need the extension to be
            added.

          </heading>
          <p>
            These files are also generated files, just as it has been
            explained above for <file>texmf.cnf</file>. The difference to
            <file>texmf.cnf</file> is that the system-wide files will
            be put into <file>/var/lib/texmf/web2c</file>, and any
            change made in these files will be <strong>unconditionally
            overwritten</strong>
            by <prgn>update-fmtutil</prgn>, <prgn>update-language</prgn>
            and
            <prgn>update-updmap</prgn>, respectively.  Only the files
	    in <file>/etc/texmf/updmap.d/</file>, <file>/etc/texmf/fmt.d/</file>
	    and <file>/etc/texmf/language.d/</file> will be treated as
	    configuration files.  Furthermore, the files <file>fmtutil.cnf</file>,
	    <file>updmap.cfg</file> and <file>language.dat</file> are
	    used on a first-found-first-used basis, if there are more
	    than one in the search path, whereas if there are
	    several <file>texmf.cnf</file> files in the search path,
	    their settings are combined as described
	    in <ref id="sec-user-config-files">.
          </p>

          <p>
            Just as for <file>texmf.cnf</file>, the right way to change
            settings is to edit or add files in
            <file>/etc/texmf/updmap.d/</file>, <file>/etc/texmf/fmt.d/</file>
            or <file>/etc/texmf/language.d/</file>. The details have been
            described above (see <ref id="sec-texmfcnf-and-update-texmf">).
            Note, however, that the extension for <file>updmap.cfg</file>
            snippets in <file>/etc/texmf/updmap.d/</file> is
            <file>.cfg</file>, not <file>.cnf</file>.
          </p>

	  <p>
	    <prgn>updmap-sys(8)</prgn> provides options for enabling
	    or disabling font map files.  When enabling a new map file
	    that is not mentioned, <prgn>updmap-sys</prgn> will first
	    create or edit <file>10local.cfg</file> in
	    the <file>/etc/texmf/updmap.d</file> directory and then
	    call <prgn>update-updmap</prgn>.  Note
	    that <prgn>updmap-sys</prgn>'s <tt>--edit</tt>
	    and <tt>--syncwithtrees</tt> options cannot be used on a
	    Debian system.

	    <prgn>update-texmf</prgn> is only available for root; if a

	    they can put it into <tt><var>TEXMFCONFIG</var>/web2c</tt>
	    and must manually edit it.  However, in order for it to be
	    found, they need to set an environment
	    variable
	    <footnote>
	      The reason for this is that the search
	      path for <file>texmf.cnf</file>, which is the file that
	      defines all search paths for later use, naturally cannot
	      be specified in the file, but is fixed at compile
	      time.
	    </footnote>:
<example>
export TEXMFCNF=$HOME/.texmf-config/web2c:
</example>
            The final colon includes the system wide default.  Since
	    all <file>texmf.cnf</file> files are read, with earlier
	    definitions taking precedence over later ones, it is best
	    to keep only a minimal set of definitions in the
	    user-specific file.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    In contrast to the above&mdash;TeX reading and merging all
	    <file>texmf.cnf</file> files&mdash;the <em>first</em> found occurrence of
	    one of the files <file>updmap.cfg</file>, <file>language.dat</file>,
	    <file>fmtutil.cnf</file> is used. Thus, when called by a
	    user, the other configuration update programs also work
	    with files in
	    <tt><var>TEXMFCONFIG</var>/updmap.d</tt>, 
	    <tt><var>TEXMFCONFIG</var>/fmt.d</tt> or

	    <var>TEXMFCONFIG</var> is usually 
	    <file><var>HOME</var>/.texmf-config</file>.  They combine
	    files in these directories with the files in the system-wide
	    directories&mdash;naturally the user-specific ones take
	    precedence if the names are equal
	    (see <ref id="sec-user-specific-installation">) &mdash;and
	    drop the respective generated file into the user's 
	    <var>TEXMFVAR</var>, effectively overriding the
	    system-wide config files. Note that changes to existing
	    configuration file snippets made by package updates will
	    not be propagated to the user's files.

	  <p>

	<heading>Font caching</heading>
	<p>
	  A TeX system needs to generate new font data (pixel data, metric,
	  sources) on the fly. These files can be saved into the TeX font cache
	  and later be reused.  By default, a separate font cache is created
	  for each user in their own TEXMFVAR directory ($HOME/.texmf-var/).
	  If this directory is not writable, e.g. during automated package
	  building, a directory called VARTEXFONTS, /tmp/texfonts/, is used
	  instead, but this directory is cleaned up regularly.
	</p>
	<p>
	  On multi-user machines, it might be advisable that the local
	  administrator enables a site-wide font cache and sets VARTEXFONTS to
	  a persistent directory, e.g. /var/cache/fonts.  The variable is set
	  in /etc/texmf/texmf.d/05TeXMF.cnf and can either be changed there or
	  preferrably overwritten in a file that sorts before 05TeXMF.cnf, e.g.
	  /etc/texmf/texmf.d/04VARTEXFONTS.cnf.  Do not forget to run
	  update-texmf after making the change.  To enable a side-wide font
	  caching the admin should edit /etc/texmf/web2c/mktex.cnf and use
	  'varfonts' instead of 'texmfvar' in MT_FEATURES.  Care should be
	  taken to specifiy appropriate permissions for the directory
	  containing the font cache.  Either the local admin should create all
	  available font data and not allow write access, or else write access
	  should be limited to trusted users.  Yet an other alternative is to
	  bind-mount /var/cache/fonts from a separate partition, so that users
	  are not able to fill up the /var partition with font data.

          In Debian teTeX packages, <prgn>dvipdfm</prgn> uses the settings in

	<p>
	  The Debian TeX Live packages currently do not evaluate the

        <p>
          In most cases, this error is the symptom of a syntax error in the
          document&mdash;TeX is getting into an infinite loop, and after
          some time all its internal registers have been used. Sometimes,
          however, a large document that loads a package that uses a lot of
          TeX's registers leads to that error, or to a similar error message.
          The package documentation, the Google archive, or TeX-related
          mailing-lists or newsgroups will be helpful to find out which
          parameter needs to be changed in <file>/etc/texmf/texmf.cnf</file>

        How to install additional or updated (La)TeX packages or fonts
      </heading>

      <p>
        If you want to install additional (La)TeX stuff, you have to:
        <!-- the compact enumlist is buggy... -->
        <enumlist>
          <item>
            install it at a place where TeX can find it;
          </item>
          <item>
            register it properly.
          </item>
        </enumlist>
      </p>

      <p>
        This can generally be done site-wide (by an administrator who has
        write access to at least <file>/usr/local/share/texmf</file> and
        <file>/etc/texmf</file>), or on a per-user basis. This can be done by
        any user on the system, without requiring write access to system
        directories. Some people might also find it more convenient in case
        they share their home directory between a couple of machines, even if
        they do have administrator rights.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the following, we first explain the principles by describing a
        site-wide setup; then we explain the details for user-specific setup.
      </p>

      <sect>
        <heading>(La)TeX input files</heading>

        <p>
          This is usually quite easy. Put the files in an appropriate
          directory below <var>TEXMFLOCAL</var>, which is the directory tree
          rooted at <file>/usr/local/share/texmf</file>.
        </p>

        <p>
          For LaTeX packages, create the directory
          <file>tex/latex/<var>packagename</var></file> within that tree (or
          use <file>tex/latex/misc</file>) and put the files there; the
          documentation should be put into
          <file>doc/latex/<var>packagename</var></file>. If the package comes
          as a pair of <file>.dtx</file> and <file>.ins</file> files, you need
          to run <prgn>latex</prgn> over the <file>.ins</file> file in order
          to produce the package files, and over the <file>.dtx</file> file to
          produce the documentation. After that, the <file>.dtx</file> and
          <file>.ins</file> files are no longer needed. Please refer to the
          <file>README</file> file of the package if there is one.
        </p>

        <p>
          After that, <em>registering</em> is easy: just run the command
          <prgn>mktexlsr</prgn> (also called <prgn>texhash</prgn>). This will
          regenerate the <file>ls-R</file> file for all <var>TEXMF</var> trees
          you have write access to.

        <heading>Complex installations</heading>

        <p>
          With some packages, e.g. when they contain fonts, the
          procedure is more complicated. Please follow the
          instructions given in the package. The Debian-specific part
          comes in when the configuration files
          <file>texmf.cnf</file>, <file>fmtutil.cnf</file>,
          <file>updmap.cfg</file>, or <file>language.dat</file> need
          to be changed. See the description above (<ref
          id="sec-core-config-files">), the manual pages for
          <prgn>update-updmap</prgn>, <prgn>update-texmf</prgn>,

        <heading>Font installation</heading>

        <p>
          If you wish to install a font package in a system-wide manner,
          please follow the instructions in this section. If you are preparing
          a Debian package containing fonts, you should refer to the Debian
          TeX policy instead, which is shipped in the
          <package>tex-common</package> package.
        </p>

        <p>
          Generally, you should first have a look at the installation
          instructions that come with the font package, in case there is
          something specific to that package with respect to installation. But
          you should make sure that you install most files in a subdirectory
          of <var>TEXMFLOCAL</var> (see <ref id="sec-texmf-trees">). This is
          because we are describing here a system-wide installation that is
          not done by Debian packages.
        </p>

        <p>
          For instance, AFM files should be stored into
          <file><var>TEXMFLOCAL</var>/fonts/afm/<var>supplier</var>/<var>typeface</var>/</file>
          where <var>supplier</var> identifies the supplier of the fonts (for
          instance, <tt>adobe</tt>, <tt>urw</tt> or <tt>public</tt>) and
          <var>typeface</var> refers to the name of the font family (e.g.,
          <tt>marvosym</tt> or <tt>lm</tt>). If in doubt, you should have a
          look at the system trees managed by Debian packages,
          <file>/usr/share/texmf</file>, <file>/usr/share/texmf-tetex</file>
          and <file>/usr/share/texmf-texlive</file>; they follow the same
          layout, called the TeX Directory Structure (which is documented at
          <url id="http://www.tug.org/tds/" name="&urlname">).
        </p>

        <p>
          In order for the various TeX-related programs to be able to use a
          font, you need to somehow register its map files (simply copying the
          files to <var>TEXMFLOCAL</var> is not enough). You can do this with
          the following steps, performed as <tt>root</tt>, where
          <var>foo</var> stands for the name of the font package you are
          installing:

          <enumlist>
            <item>
              <p>
                Make sure you have stored all the relevant files shipped in
                the package (<file>.afm</file>, <file>.tfm</file>,
                <file>.pfb</file>, <file>.pfa</file>, <file>.mf</file>,
                <file>.fd</file>, <file>.enc</file>, <file>.map</file>,
                <file>.sty</file> are all relevant in this context) in the
                appropriate subdirectories of <var>TEXMFLOCAL</var>, as
                explained above.
              </p>

                Create a configuration file
                <file>/etc/texmf/updmap.d/10local-<var>foo</var>.cfg</file>
                (the extension <file>.cfg</file> is important! You can also
                use one <file>10local.cfg</file> for all your locally
                installed fonts). The file should list the map files you
                stored in step 1 under <var>TEXMFLOCAL</var>, with one line
                per file, as in:

<example>
# This is a comment line
Map <var>foo</var>.map
Map other-map-file-from-package-<var>foo</var>.map
</example>
              </p>

              <p>
                If a font is available both as bitmap and outline, you should
                use <tt>MixedMap</tt> instead of <tt>Map</tt>. Please refer to
                the manual pages for <prgn>update-updmap</prgn> and
                <prgn>updmap-sys</prgn> for details.
              </p>

	      <p>
		You can also use <tt>updmap-sys --enable
		Map <var>foo</var>.map</tt>; this will create
		the <file>10local.cfg</file> file for you.
	      </p>
            </item>

            <item>
              <p>
                Run the program <prgn>update-updmap</prgn>. This will generate
                an appropriate <file>updmap.cfg</file> file under
                <file>/var/lib/texmf/web2c/</file> (not
                <file>/etc/texmf/</file>!), containing the <tt>Map</tt> and/or
                <tt>MixedMap</tt> lines taken from
                <file>10local-<var>foo</var>.cfg</file>.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                Note: modifying <file>updmap.cfg</file> directly is not
                supported in Debian, because Debian font packages need to
                update it when they are installed or removed. This is why
                <file>updmap.cfg</file> is not stored under <file>/etc</file>
                and why you have to use <prgn>update-updmap</prgn> whenever
                you want to modify it.

                Run the program <prgn>mktexlsr</prgn> (or
               <prgn>texhash</prgn>, which is the same). This will record all
               the newly created files in <file>ls-R</file> files (these are
               used by TeX-related programs as indices to find the files they
               need when operating).

            <item>
              <p>
                Run the program <prgn>updmap-sys</prgn>. This will use your
                updated <file>updmap.cfg</file> to generate files that are
                needed by <prgn>dvips</prgn>, <prgn>pdflatex</prgn>,
                <prgn>dvipdfm</prgn>, etc., such as <file>psfonts.map</file>
                and <file>pdftex.map</file>.

          At this point, the font package should be properly installed for all
          users on the system.

        <p>
          Instead of a system-wide installation, one can also install input
          files and fonts in the private <var>TEXMFHOME</var>, which is set to
          <file>$HOME/texmf</file> by default. For fonts, compared to the
          system-wide installation explained above, the following changes have
          to be made:

          <list>
            <item>
              In step 1, copy all relevant files to the appropriate
              subdirectories in <var>TEXMFHOME</var>.
            </item>

            <item>
              <p>
		The configuration file created in step 2 should be placed in
		<var>TEXMFCONFIG</var> (<file>$HOME/.texmf-config</file> by
		default). An appropriate place would be
		<file><var>TEXMFCONFIG</var>/updmap.d/</file>. Note that most
		likely you will have to create this directory first.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		As for the site-wide installation, you can also
		use <tt>updmap --enable Map <var>foo</var>.map</tt>.
	      </p>
            </item>

            <item>
              After updating the <file>ls-R</file> files with
              <prgn>mktexlsr</prgn> or <prgn>texhash</prgn> (step 4), one has
              to generate the map files in step 5. This is done by running the
              program <prgn>updmap</prgn> instead of <prgn>updmap-sys</prgn>.
              The generated files are created in directories below
              <var>TEXMFVAR</var>.
            </item>
          </list>
        </p>

        <p>
          Note that <prgn>update-updmap</prgn> merges the configuration files
          in <file>$HOME/.texmf-config/web2c/updmap.d</file> and in
          <file>/etc/texmf/updmap.d</file>. Therefore, all system-wide
          installed fonts are accessible without duplicating their
          configuration files. Merging the configuration files is done on the
          basis of file names: If a file exists in both directories, the
          version in <var>TEXMFCONFIG</var> takes precedence. Thus, you can
          also use this mechanism to change settings compared to the site-wide
          configuration, e.g. by keeping a changed copy of
          <file>00updmap.cfg</file> in
          <file><var>TEXMFCONFIG</var>/updmap.d/</file>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Keep in mind that you still have to call <prgn>update-updmap</prgn>
          whenever the system-wide installation
          changes. If you keep a changed copy of a file from the site-wide
          directories, you need to manually merge any changes to this file, if
          desired.

        If the installation failed, please check the following points:

        <list compact>
          <item>
            Is there enough room on your hard disk?
          </item>

          <item>
            Is there any privately-compiled TeX system besides the Debian
            packages?
          </item>

          <item>
            Does the command:
<example>
kpsewhich --format=cnf texmf
</example>
            return <file>/usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf</file>?
          </item>

          <item>
            Is <file>texmf.cnf</file> modified a lot? Please check
            <file>/etc/texmf/texmf.d/</file>.
          </item>

          <item>
            Did you set any TeX-related environment variable?
          </item>

          <item>
            Try again. This might work in some cases.

           <prgn>texdoctk</prgn>, <tt>txfonts</tt>, <tt>pxfonts</tt>, etc.,
           you need <package>tetex-extra</package> at present.
           (<prgn>pdftex</prgn>/<prgn>pdflatex</prgn> should work basically
           only with <package>tetex-base</package> now.)

        How to report a bug:

        <list compact>
          <item>
            Please calm down anyway. ;)
          </item>

          <item>
            Please check the Debian Bug Tracking System first.
          </item>

          <item>
            Please read carefully the error messages, if any. It will help
            both you and us.
          </item>

          <item>
            Please use <prgn>reportbug</prgn> and include all
            information it gathers
          </item>

          <item>
            Please attach a simple and short sample file which causes the
            problem you want to report.
          </item>

          <item>
            Be prepared that we will have to ask more questions:  You
            should have time to exchange a couple of e-mails with us
          </item>

          <item>
            It will be helpful to show us the output of the command:
<example>
ls /etc/texmf/texmf.d/*
</example>
          </item>

          <item>
            If you see something like:

<example>
Unpacking replacement tetex-base ...
dpkg: error processing /var/cache/../tetex-base_*_all.deb (--unpack): trying to overwrite `/usr/share/texmf/dvips/config', which is also in package foo
</example>

            then the problem should be of package <package>foo</package>, not
            of <package>tetex-base</package>.

          <item>
            Note that teTeX is not further developed upstream, and new
            features will only be integrated in TeX Live.  The Debian
            maintainers will not include anything in the TeX Live
            packages that is not already in TeX Live upstream.
